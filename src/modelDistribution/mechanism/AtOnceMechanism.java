	/**
	 * OLD VERSION:
	 * This method executes the transaction in the real good assuming that each agent buy at once all the stock of
	 * goods agreed with the GoodSupplier (or the stock available if not enough goods left). 
	 * It implements the SF consistency of the transaction:
	 * a)First it gets the total stock of items of the type to be sold from the SM of the GoodSupplier and determine the totalAmount 
	 * to be paid.
	 * b)It asks the GoodSupplier which kind of mean of payment he desires for the payment (fixed at the market level):deposits or cash
	 * c)It creates a list of items representing the stocks at disposal of the GoodDemander in order to pay.
	 * d)till the amount raised<required: It takes the first element of payingStocks, takes its value,
	 * add it to the amountRaised, calculates the remaining value of this paying stock (max(0,amountRaised-totalAmount)
	 * and set its new value (0 if not sufficient to fill the gap with totalAmount).
	 * e)If the above payingStock is off the class requested by the GoodSupplier then skip the if and:
	 *   e.1) realize the transfer of payable stock from GoodDemander to GoodSupplier. If the amountRaised still<required it buys only what it can (goods are
	 *   no integer units). e.2) create the new capital or consumption good to be transferred e.3) remove the quantity sold from GoodSupplier's inventories
	 *   and add the item bought to GoodDemander SM.
	 * d) If instead the payingStock is not off the class requested by the GoodSupplier, 2 cases: 
	 *    d.1) it's a deposits but GoodSupplier wants cash: first we have to draw money from that deposit and then update bank's reserve of cash
	 *    d.2) it's cash but GoodSupplier wants deposit: first we have to deposit the cash and then update the bank's reserve of money. 
	 *    ! In both cases we don't have to update the cash holdings/deposits respectively of the GoodDemander since this amount is immediately transferred to the GoodSupplier to buy the good.
	 * Then, follow e.1. to e.3
